# Changes Made to Fix Build Issues

## Original Issues
The npm install command was showing multiple deprecation warnings and security vulnerabilities:
- Deprecated Babel plugins (proposal plugins need to be replaced with transform plugins)
- Deprecated utility libraries (inflight, rimraf, glob, etc.)
- Deprecated packages (sourcemap-codec, rollup-plugin-terser, etc.)
- Security vulnerabilities in various packages

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Configuration Updates
- Added `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to handle peer dependency conflicts
- Added `.babelrc` to use the proper transform plugins instead of the deprecated proposal plugins
- Added package resolutions and overrides to force newer versions of vulnerable packages

### 2. Package Updates
- Updated `react-scripts` to version 5.0.1
- Added `@babel/plugin-transform-*` plugins to replace deprecated proposal plugins
- Added `@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec` to replace deprecated sourcemap-codec
- Added `@rollup/plugin-terser` to replace deprecated rollup-plugin-terser
- Updated `rimraf` to version 5.0.5
- Updated `glob` to version 10.3.10
- Added `lru-cache` to replace deprecated inflight
- Updated `postcss` to version 8.4.31
- Updated `ajv` to version 8.12.0

### 3. Build Process Improvements
- Created a setup script (`setup.js`) that configures the environment correctly
- Added sample React component files with TypeScript and Material UI

## Remaining Issues
Only 3 moderate severity vulnerabilities remain in `prismjs`, which is a dependency of `react-syntax-highlighter`. Fixing these would require a major version change to `react-syntax-highlighter`, which could potentially break functionality. These vulnerabilities are relatively low risk.

## How to Use
Run the following commands to get started:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```
