## Overview

Keeping dependencies up-to-date is essential for:
- **Security**: Patching known vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Taking advantage of optimizations
- **Features**: Accessing new capabilities and improvements
- **Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with other libraries and the ecosystem

However, updating dependencies comes with risks:
- Breaking changes
- Incompatibilities
- Regressions

Our approach aims to balance these concerns with a structured, incremental update process.

## Dependency Update Strategy

We follow a risk-based approach to dependency updates:

1. **Categorize** dependencies by risk level (low, medium, high)
2. **Batch updates** by risk category
3. **Test thoroughly** after each batch
4. **Document** changes and potential impacts

## Risk Classification

Dependencies are classified into risk levels:

| Risk Level | Description | Update Frequency | Approach |
|------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Low** | Patch updates (1.0.x → 1.0.y) | Monthly | Batch updates |
| **Medium** | Minor updates (1.x → 1.y) | Quarterly | Staged updates with testing |
| **High** | Major updates (x → y) | As needed | Individual updates with extensive testing |
| **Critical** | Core framework/libraries | Carefully planned | Incremental updates with compatibility verification |

## Using the Update Script

We've created an automated script (`scripts/update-dependencies.js`) to assist with dependency updates:

```bash
# Show what would be updated without making changes
node scripts/update-dependencies.js --dry-run

# Only update patch versions (safer)
node scripts/update-dependencies.js --patch-only

# Skip running tests after updates (not recommended)
node scripts/update-dependencies.js --skip-tests

# Specify a file to output the update report
node scripts/update-dependencies.js --report-file update-report.md
```

The script handles:
1. Analyzing current dependencies
2. Creating backups before making changes
3. Categorizing updates by risk level
4. Updating dependencies in batches
5. Verifying the project still works after updates
6. Generating a report of changes

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular dependency updates rather than letting them accumulate
2. **Update in Small Batches**: Prefer multiple small updates over one large update
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always run tests after updates
4. **Review Changelogs**: Read release notes for breaking changes
5. **Update Related Dependencies Together**: When a library has peer dependencies
6. **Use Lockfiles**: Ensure repeatable builds with package-lock.json
7. **Be Cautious with Pre-releases**: Only use alpha/beta versions when necessary

## Handling Critical Dependencies

For the MCP SDK and other critical dependencies:

1. **Incremental Updates**: For significant version jumps, update through intermediate versions
2. **Compatibility Testing**: Verify compatibility with existing code
3. **API Changes**: Document any API changes that require code modifications
4. **Testing**: Perform more extensive testing for critical dependency updates

Special handling is necessary for:
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - Core MCP framework
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `typescript` - Type system

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after dependency updates:

1. **Consult the Report**: Check the update report for failed updates
2. **Review Logs**: Look for error messages during the update process
3. **Rollback if Necessary**: Revert to the backup package.json if needed
4. **Isolate Problems**: Try updating one dependency at a time to identify issues
5. **Check Compatibility**: Verify version compatibility between peer dependencies

## Automated Dependency Management

For future enhancement, consider implementing:

1. **Dependency Bot**: Integrate GitHub Dependabot or Renovate
2. **CI Workflow**: Add CI jobs for testing dependency updates
3. **Security Scanning**: Use npm audit or other security scanning tools
4. **Update Schedule**: Establish a regular schedule for dependency updates

By following these guidelines, we can maintain up-to-date dependencies while minimizing risk to the project.
