# Triepod AI Assets

This directory contains assets for the Triepod AI fork of Claude Computer Commander.

## triepod-logo.png

The README.md references this logo file which should be placed in this directory. You can:

1. Add your Triepod AI logo to this directory as `triepod-logo.png`
2. Upload the logo to the GitHub repository after pushing the code
3. The logo will then be accessible via the raw GitHub URL referenced in the README

The current placeholder URL in the README is:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triepod-ai/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/assets/triepod-logo.png
```

Once you push your code to GitHub, this path will correctly display your logo in the README.
